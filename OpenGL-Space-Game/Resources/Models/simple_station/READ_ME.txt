here is a model for your Space Station, there are 2 versions
one is an inconstruct version which has less objects/polys and therefore will render faster. The other is a more complete but quite taxing model with some issues you need to overcome.

This is about the biggest model you will attempt to run on a RPi, I can assure you it will load and render at a good frame rate, but you will need to carefully consider how to tackle it, there are issues with some of the graphic formats and you WILL have to make edits...this is the way!

The model itself is a deconstructed version of a free model from Turbo squid which originally had 3 spokes but that proved to be too much.


Adapt, modify, alter, review and refine....But try not to spend longer than a couple of days. If you can't make it work...find an alternative.
